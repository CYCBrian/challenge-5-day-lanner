## Description

The Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am to 5pm). This application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It uses the Day.js library to work with date and time.

## User Story

As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

## Features


1. **Current Date Display:** 
   - When you open the planner, the current day and date is displayed at the top of the calendar.

2. **Timeblocks:**
   - As you scroll down, you are presented with time blocks for the standard business hours of 9am to 5pm.

3. **Color-Coded Timeblocks:**
   - Each timeblock is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green).

4. **Enter Events:**
   - You can click into a time block to enter an event.

5. **Save Events:**
   - After entering an event, you can click the save button for that time block, and the text for that event is saved in local storage.

6. **Persistent Data:**
   - Even if you refresh the page, the saved events persist, ensuring you don't lose your important schedule.
